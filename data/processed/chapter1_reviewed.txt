**The Gates of Morning**

**Book 1, Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick perched on a coral ledge, scanning the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind. Before him, the tranquil blue lagoon of Karolin stretched—a vast expanse alive only with the cries of circling gulls. This immense, coral-ringed lagoon, a tempestuous sea in gales, a placid lake in gentler breezes, was now his.  A castaway arrived only yesterday, he claimed this land, its people, its resources. Women, children, and youths—the entire tribe—bustled along the beach under the relentless sun, fishing, playing, and tending their taro patches.  The canoes, pulled high on the sand, once sheltering war canoes, were now his.  The empty houses stood as silent testament.

His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown etching itself onto his brow. Turning from the serene water, he faced the crashing waves of the outer beach and the vast northern sea. Beyond the horizon, unseen, lay Palm Tree, an island of breathtaking beauty, yet a viper's nest of savagery.

Little Tari, Le Taioi the net maker's son, watched him from the coral.  Still a child, Tari understood only that war had swept away Karolin's men, leaving the women and children defenseless and leaderless. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the northern sea, bearing this enigmatic man and Katafa, the girl lost at sea years before. The women whispered that he was a god-sent chief.

Tari, unburdened by adult complexities, posed his question directly: "Taori," he asked, his childlike simplicity echoing in his voice, "who are you?"

Could Dick have answered truthfully? Could the child have comprehended the stranger's story? He might have said, "Tari, I come from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange, and as a child, smaller even than you, I was left alone on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles to the north, with an old sailor, Kearney. He taught me to survive, to fish, to build small ships unlike your canoes. Then Katafa came, the girl blown away from here. After Kearney died, we escaped from Melanesian raiders who burned their ship and ravaged the island, fleeing in our small boat, guided by the lagoon's light, until we reached Karolin."

But he couldn't tell Tari all this. The name "Dick" and his childhood language were lost to him, swallowed by the luminous haze of a forgotten past. For the shipwrecked and alone, time blurs, memories fade. His own past began only with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Everything before was lost, obscured by the relentless tropical sun, the storms, and the monsoon rains. Only the little ships Kearney had made remained, tangible remnants of a nearly forgotten past.


He looked down at the child's questioning gaze.  "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied, his attention already diverted.  "I ask as I breathe, but grown-ups never answer Tari's questions.  Ai, the fish!" He scrambled away, drawn by the excited cries of children hauling in a net.

Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question had stirred dormant memories. He saw again the schooner, burned by the Melanesians; Katafa and himself escaping in Kearney’s dinghy; their arrival on this beach and the women and children crowding around him, believing him a divine messenger, their chief.  But the memory of the men he'd escaped with, and the brutality they'd shown, stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate threat; the men of Palm Tree had no canoes. But they would build them. They would see the shimmering light of Karolin lagoon, just as he had, and they would come. It might be a long time, but they would come. Dick was essentially a native, a kanaka, yet the white man's mind remained within him. He could strategize, anticipate, and imagine.

That was why he'd sent a canoe to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three old men, past their fighting days, but skilled canoe builders. That was why, when observing the assembled tribe, his eyes had lit upon nearly a hundred youths ripe for war. Underpinning all his actions and plans was his fierce, intense, and vulnerable love for Katafa.

War canoes! Was he planning to defend against invaders in the lagoon, or launch a preemptive strike? Only time would tell.


A hand rested on his shoulder. Turning, he saw Katafa; a stray lock of dark hair, escaping the vine that bound it, fluttered like an eagle's feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern horizon, the same point he'd been gazing at.

"Look," Katafa breathed.

Under specific weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible through mirage. They'd seen it last night, and now it was reappearing, a smudge in the sky, a dull spot in the sea's brilliance that gradually intensified until, like an artist’s brushstroke, the island emerged—ethereal yet vibrant, beautiful as a dream.

Shoulder to shoulder, they stood silent, their untutored minds oblivious to the science of the mirage, their eyes locked on the scene of their escape, now strangely rising from the sea as if to watch them. They saw the savages on the beach again, monstrous figures from a nightmare; they felt the wind in the sails of their dinghy as they fled; they heard the drunken yells of the Melanesians, fueled by stolen rum. And there, before them, lay the island, a breathtaking picture concealing the demons that still inhabited it.

As Dick gazed at this vision, both beautiful and threatening, hate flared in his eyes. They had threatened him, but it was the threat to Katafa that ignited his fury. They still threatened her.

Someday, they would come. The image of Palm Tree seemed to echo his instinct. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's light, and come. Those men had no women, and here were women. His own attraction to Katafa mirrored the instinct that would draw them to Karolin. They would scan the horizon, seeking a vulnerable tribe, and Karolin's light would guide them.

He realized then that danger lay not only in the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed the azure sea—not just amongst savages, but within the wolves of civilization.

For Dick, the world was confined to the water that ringed the two islands, a world without Europe, America, or history beyond his short life and Katafa's. Yet, even within that limited world, he understood fear, the primal instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.

Gradually, the vision of Palm Tree faded, then vanished. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe. It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sand to meet it.
